  * @brief   CMSIS Cortex-M4 Device Peripheral Access Layer System Source File.
  *
  *   This file provides two functions and one global variable to be called from
  *   user application:
  *      - SystemInit(): This function is called at startup just after reset and
  *                      before branch to main program. This call is made inside
  *                      the "startup_stm32f4xx.s" file.
  *
  *      - SystemCoreClock variable: Contains the core clock (HCLK), it can be used
  *                                  by the user application to setup the SysTick
  *                                  timer or configure other parameters.
  *
  *      - SystemCoreClockUpdate(): Updates the variable SystemCoreClock and must
  *                                 be called whenever the core clock is changed
  *                                 during program execution.

  * @brief  Update SystemCoreClock variable according to Clock Register Values.
  *         The SystemCoreClock variable contains the core clock (HCLK), it can
  *         be used by the user application to setup the SysTick timer or configure
  *         other parameters.
  *
  * @note   Each time the core clock (HCLK) changes, this function must be called
  *         to update SystemCoreClock variable value. Otherwise, any configuration
  *         based on this variable will be incorrect.
  *
  * @note   - The system frequency computed by this function is not the real
  *           frequency in the chip. It is calculated based on the predefined
  *           constant and the selected clock source:
  *
  *           - If SYSCLK source is HSI, SystemCoreClock will contain the HSI_VALUE(*)
  *
  *           - If SYSCLK source is HSE, SystemCoreClock will contain the HSE_VALUE(**)
  *
  *           - If SYSCLK source is PLL, SystemCoreClock will contain the HSE_VALUE(**)
  *             or HSI_VALUE(*) multiplied/divided by the PLL factors.
  *
  *         (*) HSI_VALUE is a constant defined in stm32f4xx_hal_conf.h file (default value
  *             16 MHz) but the real value may vary depending on the variations
  *             in voltage and temperature.
  *
  *         (**) HSE_VALUE is a constant defined in stm32f4xx_hal_conf.h file (its value
  *              depends on the application requirements), user has to ensure that HSE_VALUE
  *              is same as the real frequency of the crystal used. Otherwise, this function
  *              may have wrong result.
  *
  *         - The result of this function could be not correct when using fractional
  *           value for HSE crystal.
  *
  * @param  None
  * @retval None
